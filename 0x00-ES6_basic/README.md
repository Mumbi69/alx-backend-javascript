# ES6 Basics
* JavaScript is a versatile scripting language commonly used for building dynamic web applications.
* ECMAScript Standards: avaScript is based on ECMAScript (ES) standards. ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) was a significant update that introduced features like arrow functions, classes, template literals, and destructuring assignments. Subsequent versions, such as ES7, ES8, and so on, have brought additional improvements.
* Asynchronous Programming: Promises and async/await are modern approaches to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and maintainable way compared to callbacks.
* Module System: ES6 introduced a native module system, allowing developers to organize their code into reusable and maintainable modules.
* Arrow Functions: A concise syntax for writing functions, especially useful for short, anonymous functions.
* Classes: A more structured way to define object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript.
* Template Literals: A more flexible and readable way to work with strings, allowing the embedding of expressions directly.
* Destructuring Assignments: A concise way to extract values from arrays or objects.
* Spread and Rest Operators: Useful for manipulating arrays and objects.
* A software linter, is a tool used to analyze code for potential errors, enforce coding standards, and ensure consistent style across a codebase. The term "linter" originally comes from the Unix utility lint, which flagged suspicious and non-portable constructs in C code.
