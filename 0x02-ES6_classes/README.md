# ES6 classes
* How to Define a Class:
> * In JavaScript, you can define a class using the class keyword.
* How to add methods to a class:
> * You can add methods to a class by defining functions within the class. In the example above, speak is a method.
* Why and how to add a static method to a class:
> * Static methods are called on the class itself, not on instances of the class. They are useful for utility functions related to the class but not dependent on an instance.
* How to extend a class from another:
> * You can use the extends keyword to create a subclass that inherits from a superclass.
* Metaprogramming and Symbols:
> * Metaprogramming involves writing code that manipulates code during runtime. Symbols are a primitive data type introduced in ES6 that can be used for metaprogramming. They provide a way to create unique property keys.
