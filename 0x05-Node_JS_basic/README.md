# NodeJS Basics
* Running JavaScript using Node.js: Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. You can create JavaScript files with Node.js code and run them using the node command in your terminal.

* Using Node.js modules: Node.js uses a module system to organize and reuse code. You can create your own modules using module.exports and require, and you can also use built-in modules or install third-party modules using npm (Node Package Manager).

* Using a specific Node.js module to read files: You can use the built-in fs (File System) module in Node.js to read files. For example, you can use fs.readFile to read a file asynchronously or fs.readFileSync to read a file synchronously.

* Using process to access command-line arguments and the environment: The process object in Node.js provides information about the current Node.js process, including command-line arguments (process.argv) and environment variables (process.env).

* Creating a small HTTP server using Node.js: You can create an HTTP server in Node.js using the built-in http module. You can use http.createServer to create a server and listen for incoming requests using the server.listen method.

* Creating a small HTTP server using Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of creating web servers. You can create an HTTP server with Express.js using the express module and defining routes using app.get, app.post, etc.
 
* Creating advanced routes with Express.js: Express.js allows you to create advanced routes by using route parameters, middleware functions, and route handlers. You can define routes that match specific patterns and handle requests accordingly.

* Using ES6 with Node.js with Babel-node: Node.js has support for ES6 features, but not all features are natively supported in all versions of Node.js. You can use Babel to transpile your ES6 code to ES5, which is compatible with older versions of Node.js.

* Using Nodemon to develop faster: Nodemon is a tool that helps you develop Node.js applications faster by automatically restarting the Node.js process when changes are detected in your files. This allows you to see the effects of your changes immediately without having to manually restart the server.
